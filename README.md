## How It Works  

AccelDedup uses the following workflow:  

1. **File Upload**  
   - Users upload files through a responsive web interface.  

2. **Hash Generation**  
   - Each file is processed with SHA-256 to generate a unique hash for identification.  

3. **Duplicate Check**  
   - The system checks incoming hashes against stored records to identify duplicates.  

4. **Storage Optimization**  
   - Unique files are stored, while duplicates are replaced with references, saving storage space.  

5. **Reporting**  
   - Users receive detailed reports on storage usage and deduplication efficiency.
