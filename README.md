# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### npm test

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### npm run build

Builds the app for production to the build folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### npm run eject

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

# Acceldedup  

**Acceldedup** is a powerful tool designed to optimize workflows by accelerating data processing and eliminating redundant information efficiently. Whether you're working with large datasets, files, or records, Acceldedup helps improve performance and storage usage by intelligently identifying and handling duplicate content.  

## Key Features  

- **High-speed deduplication**: Quickly scans and identifies duplicate data across various formats.  
- **Customizable rules**: Define your own criteria for deduplication and acceleration.  
- **Scalable performance**: Optimized for small-scale projects to enterprise-level datasets.  
- **Compatibility**: Supports multiple file formats (e.g., CSV, JSON, XML) and database inputs.  
- **Report generation**: Creates detailed logs and summaries for processed data.  

## Installation  

To use Acceldedup, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:  

```bash  
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/acceldedup.git  
cd acceldedup  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```  

## How It Works  

Acceldedup operates through three main phases:  

1. **Data Ingestion**  
   - Imports data from files, databases, or APIs.  
   - Supports formats like CSV, JSON, XML, or database connectors like PostgreSQL and MySQL.  

2. **Deduplication Engine**  
   - Processes the ingested data using advanced algorithms to identify duplicates based on:  
     - Exact matching  
     - Fuzzy logic for approximate matches  
     - Custom matching criteria (e.g., specific fields or thresholds).  

3. **Acceleration & Optimization**  
   - Organizes data in optimized structures for faster access.  
   - Reduces redundancy to minimize storage usage.  

4. **Output & Reporting**  
   - Saves cleaned and optimized data in the desired format.  
   - Generates a summary report highlighting the total duplicates removed, time taken, and final size reduction.  

## Usage  

Run the script with the desired configuration:  

```bash  
python acceldedup.py --input data.csv --output cleaned_data.csv --log report.txt  
```  

### Arguments  

| Argument       | Description                                         |  
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|  
| `--input`      | Path to the input file or database connection string. |  
| `--output`     | Path to save the deduplicated data.                 |  
| `--log`        | Path to save the log and report.                    |  
| `--mode`       | Deduplication mode (e.g., `exact`, `fuzzy`).        |  
| `--fields`     | Specify fields/columns for deduplication criteria.  |  

### Example  

```bash  
python acceldedup.py --input customers.csv --output cleaned_customers.csv --log dedup_report.txt --mode fuzzy --fields name,email  
```  

## Functions and Workflow  

### Main Functions  

1. **`ingest_data(input_path)`**  
   - Reads data from the specified source.  
   - Supports file formats (CSV, JSON) and database connections.  

2. **`deduplicate(data, mode='exact', fields=None)`**  
   - Processes the dataset to identify and remove duplicates.  
   - Modes:  
     - `exact`: Matches identical entries.  
     - `fuzzy`: Matches approximately similar entries.  
   - Fields: Specifies which columns or fields to analyze.  

3. **`optimize_data(data)`**  
   - Optimizes data structure for performance and storage.  

4. **`save_output(data, output_path)`**  
   - Exports the processed data to the specified location.  

5. **`generate_report(stats, log_path)`**  
   - Creates a report detailing the processing outcome.
